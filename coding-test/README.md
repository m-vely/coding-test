# coding-test
This is a C program that contains a function for the Fibonacci series

How to compile the source code:
-------------
To compile the source code, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the C file. Then, use the following command:

gcc -o recursive recursive.c

Replace `recursive` with the desired name for the compiled executable and `recursive.c` with the name of the specific C source code file.

Development Environment used: Visual Studio C Compiler
IDE version: VS Code version 1.72
I used the IDE for writing and editing the code before running it on the terminal.
